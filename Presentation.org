* How to export to PDF                                             :noexport:

Do: C-c C-e l P.

Note that is P instead of p.

Because you are now exporting using beamer.

* Plan                                                             :noexport:

You'll have 20 minutes if I'm right, please confirm with the secretary.

- outline                 :: 1
- motivation              :: 2-3
  - Pajé Overview - with image to illustrate entities (maybe split in
    two to have both hierarchies (types and entities))
    - the image would bethe same that is in the text but including the
      other entities so we's have all illustrated.
  - Pajé architecture - important to show later in the results that
    this may be the cause it is slower.
  - Three issues
- proposal (aiyra + plugins)  :: 4-6
  - aiyra architecture - I think the image is enough to explain
    Aiyra. Maybe some keywords. 
 - Core and plugin packages (I think it can be all in the same
   slide. They are strictly connected. The controller can be explained
   in the previous slide, it does no have many things inside it to
   highlight. The core has that part of the PajeSimulator and
   PajeContainer that is important.
- PajeNullPlugin
- PajeDumpPlugin
- PajeInserDBPlugin (I think it needs two slides)
  - The image of the dissertation, and details about the
    implementation (batches).
  - The schema
- results                 :: TBD
  - Overview (very overview about the two tests).
  * I think the methodology and results could be all together for each
    experiment. Thus we would have a full "path" for each.
  - Methodology of cpp comparison
  - Results (as many slides as results)
  - Methodology of inserdbplugin
  - Results separated by section. 
    * Figure out some type of aggrupation. Like big and medium inputs
      in the same slide.
- conclusion              :: 1
  - Positive Results (I don't think it needs an overview, just, when
    talking about the result mention the proposal. Ex: We saw that by
    deataching the core simulator and by changing the event decoding
    we got good results...).
 - Negative points: Java, JVM, memory. 
 - Things to improve: entry points
 - Future work 
- repository/marketing    :: 1
* Context/Introduction
** 
*** Context

This is my first slide contents, write it as usual.

You can also use items

- such as this
- and this

Feel free to add figures as well

Slides are the third level (***), while "sections" are the first
level. The second level is usually empty and serves as subsection. We
can change that if you think subsections are unnecessary (note that
here I have kept it without title to make it out of toc).

*** Problem statement, motivation and objective

_Comentários_:

11:12

- Slide 4
  - Bastante tempo gasto neste slide (5 minutos +-)
  - O ponto cabeçalho e corpo aparece depois da figura
    - Diminuir a figura um pouco de tamanho
- Slide 5
  - Desnecessário falar sobre extra fields
  - PFR não salva em memória
- Slide 6
  - Problemas
  - O objetivo desse trabalho é...

11:20

- Slide 7

11:25

- Slide 10
  - Quais são os fatores possíveis?
    - Mas falou depois no Slide 11
    - Continua falando que faz fatorial completo, mas fatores/níveis
      depende dos experimentos realizados; então detalha isso depois.
- Slide 11
  - 30 replicações, falar da média e do CI
- Slide 12
  - Sublinhar _without compilation flags_
- Slide 13
  - Compilação com -O3
    - Gráfico faltando

11:30

- Slide 14
  - O que são os valores 256, 501, 312?
    - Tirar esses valores mínimos
- Slide 15
  - Colocar depois dos resultados locais
    - Movido para antes do slide 22
- Slide 16
  - Tempo vai decaindo conforme vai aumentando o tamanho de batch.
    - Na realidade é a _quantidade_ de batches
- Slide 19
  - Green color hard to see when datashow is on
    - Não muda
- Slide 22
  - São 2 hops de distância.
- Slide 25
  - Supreende com rastros de execução

11:41

- Conclusion starts
- Slide 27
  - Fora de ordem não necessariamente um problema
- Slide 28
  - Thank + Propaganda
    - Add LabBook (reproducibility)
    - Tutorial how to use, how to compile...
  - Dúvidas
  - Nome/email
